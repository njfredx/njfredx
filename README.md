Hello
My name is Nathaniel Fredricks. 
I am a current Computer Engineering student at University of Arkansas.
This is my GitHub for all the projects that I am allowed to upload.
I enjoy programming for GBA, making text generators in Python, and designing physics simulations in Unity.
For the projects that I was not able to upload, I put them on my project potfolio website: www.njfredricksprojekt.com
